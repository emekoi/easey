# easey

![Build Status](https://github.com/emekoi/easey/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

easy to use easing functions based on the [easing function cheat sheet](https://easings.net/en#). all the easing functions take a `Fractional` and return one as well and try to be point free when possible. a ~~crappy~~ simple tweeing module (`Easey.Tween`) is included as well.
